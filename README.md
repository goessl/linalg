# linalg

A type-independent and exact linear algebra package.
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from fractions import Fraction
>>> from linalg import det_laplace
>>> A = np.array([[Fraction( 9, 5), Fraction(-3, 4), Fraction( -1, 4)],
...               [Fraction( 5, 7), Fraction(-7, 2), Fraction(  9, 4)],
...               [Fraction(10, 9), Fraction( 1, 7), Fraction(-10, 7)]])
>>> det_laplace(A)
Fraction(84379, 17640)
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/linalg.git
```

## Usage

### Leibniz

- `det_leibniz(A)`: Return the determinant of `A`. Calculates the determinant by the Leibniz formula.
- `minor_leibniz(A, i, j)`: Return the `i,j`-th minor of `A`. See `det_leibniz` for more.

### Laplace

- `det_laplace(A)`: Return the determinant of `A`. Calculates the determinant by Laplace expansion. Uses the row/column with the most zero elements.
- `minor_laplace(A, i, j)`: Return the `i,j`-th minor of `A`. See `det_laplace` for more.

### Bareiss

- `det_bareiss(A)`: Return the determinant of an integer matrix `A`. Calculates the determinant by the Bareiss algorithm. Transforms `A` in place.

### Random Creation

- `randint(low, high=None, size=None)`: Return a random `int` or an array of random `int`s. Like `numpy.random.randint` but with native `int`s.
- `randf(shape=None, precision=1000)`: Return a random `Fraction` or an array of random `Fraction`s. Their numerators `n` are `-precision <= n <= +precision` and their denominators `d` are `1 <= d <= +precision`.

### Utility

- `_prod(iterable)`: Like `math.prod` but for non-numeric types. `math.prod` might reject non-numeric types: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.prod. For `float`s keep using `math.prod` for better precision.
- `swap_rows(A, i, j)`: Swap the `i`-th and `j`-th row of `A` in-place.
- `swap_columns(A, i, j)`: Swap the `i`-th and `j`-th column of `A` in-place.
- `swap_pivot(A, p, i, j)`: Swap the `p`-&`i`-th rows and `p`-&`j`-th columns of `A` in-place.
- `submatrix(A, i, j)`: Return a copy of `A` without the `i`-th row and `j`-th column.
- `_permutations(iterable, r=None)`: `itertools.permutation`, but yields `permutation, parity`.

## Conventions

- Matrices are represented as `numpy.ndarray`s.

## todo

- [ ] `sum` & `prod` for non-numeric types (`math.prod` might reject non-numerics; both have `start` argument with unnecessary additional operation; but have better float precision -> automatic fallback?)
- [ ] complexities
- [ ] progress visualisation with `tqdm`
- [ ] minimum dimensions (do functions work for 0x0-matrices?)

# linalg

A type-independent and exact linear algebra package.
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from fractions import Fraction
>>> from linalg import det_laplace
>>> A = np.array([[Fraction( 9, 5), Fraction(-3, 4), Fraction( -1, 4)],
...               [Fraction( 5, 7), Fraction(-7, 2), Fraction(  9, 4)],
...               [Fraction(10, 9), Fraction( 1, 7), Fraction(-10, 7)]])
>>> det_laplace(A)
Fraction(84379, 17640)
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/linalg.git
```

## Usage

### Laplace

- `det_laplace(A)`: Return the determinant of `A`. Calculates the determinant by Laplace expansion. Uses the row/column with the most zero elements.
- `minor_laplace(A, i, j)`: Return the `i,j`-th minor of `A`. See `det_laplace` for more.

### Utility

- `randf(shape=None, precision=1000)`: Return a random `Fraction` or an array of random `Fraction`s. Their numerators `n` are `-precision <= n <= +precision` and their denominators `d` are `1 <= d <= +precision`.
- `submatrix(A, i, j)`: Return a copy of `A` without the `i`-th row and `j`-th column.

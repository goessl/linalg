>>> from fractions import Fraction
>>> from linalg import det_laplace
>>> A = np.array([[Fraction( 9, 5), Fraction(-3, 4), Fraction( -1, 4)],
...               [Fraction( 5, 7), Fraction(-7, 2), Fraction(  9, 4)],
...               [Fraction(10, 9), Fraction( 1, 7), Fraction(-10, 7)]])
>>> det_laplace(A)
Fraction(84379, 17640)
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/linalg.git
```

## Usage

- `matmul(A, B, progress=set())`: Return the matrix product of `A` & `B`.
  Matrices must be non-empty (L,N,M>0).
  For a LxN- & a NxM-matrix (where the result will be LxM) there will be
  - $L(N-1)M$ additions (`+`),
  - $LNM$ multiplications (`*`),
  - so $L(2N-1)M$ operations in total.

### Leibniz

- `det_leibniz(A)`: Return the determinant of `A`.
  Calculates the determinant by the Leibniz formula.
  For a NxN-matrix there will be
  - $N!-1$ additions (`+`),
  - $(N-1)N!$ multiplications (`*`),
  - so $NN!-1$ operations in total.

### Laplace

- `det_laplace(A)`: Return the determinant of `A`.
  Calculates the determinant by Laplace expansion.
  Uses the row/column with the most zero elements.
  For a NxN-matrix there will be
  - $N!-1$ additions (`+`),
  - $\lfloor(e-1)N!\rfloor-1$ multiplications (`*`) (https://oeis.org/A038156),
  - so $\lfloor eN!\rfloor-2$ operations in total (https://oeis.org/A026243).

### Gauss

- `det_gauss(A)`: Return the determinant of `A`.
  Calculates the determinant by Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting.
  The matrix will be transformed in place into an upper triangular matrix (columns left of pivot won't be reduced).
  For a NxN-matrix there will be
  - $N(N^2-1)/3$ subtractions (`-`),
  - $N(N^2+2)/3-1$ multiplications (`*`),
  - $N(N-1)/2$ divisions (`/`),
  - so $N(4N^2+3N-1)/6-1$ operations in total.
- `inv_gauss(A)`: Return the inverse of `A`.
  Calculates the inverse by Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting.
  The matrix will be transformed in place into the identity matrix.
  For a NxN-matrix there will be
  - $N^3-N^2$ additions (`+`),
  - $2N^3-3N^2+2N-1$ subtractions (`-`),
  - $3N^3-3N^2$ multiplications (`*`),
  - $2N^2$ divisions (`/`),
  - so $6N^3-5N^2+2N-1$ operations in total.

### Bareiss

- `det_bareiss(A)`: Return the determinant of an integer matrix `A`.
  Calculates the determinant by the Bareiss algorithm.
  Transforms `A` in place.
  For a NxN-matrix there will be
  - $N(N^2-1)/3$ subtractions (`-`),
  - $2N(N^2-1)/3$ multiplications (`*`),
  - $N(N^2-3N+2)/3$ floor divisions (`//`),
  - so $N(4N^2-3N-1)/3$ operations in total.

### Adjugate

- `minor(A, i, j, det=det_gauss)`: Return the `i,j`-th minor of `A`.
  Uses the given determinant algorithm.
- `cofactor(A, i, j, det=det_gauss)`: Return the `i,j`-th cofactor of `A`.
  Uses the given determinant algorithm.
- `adj(A, det=det_gauss)`: Return the adjugate of `A`.
  Uses the given determinant algorithm.
- `cof(A, det=det_gauss)`: Return the cofactor matrix of `A`.
  Uses the given determinant algorithm.

### LU

- `is_perm(P)`: Return if `P` is a permutation matrix.
- `is_tril(L)`: Return if `L` is lower triangular.
- `is_triu(U)`: Return if `U` is upper triangular.
- `LU(A)`: Return the LU decomposition of `A`.
  Transformation happens in-place (`A` becomes `U` for Doolittle, `L` for Crout).
  For a MxN-matrix returns a MxM- & MxN-matrix for Doolittle or MxN- & NxN-matrix for Crout (automatically most memory efficient).
  Doolittle decomposition ($l_{ii}=1$) if `M<=N`, Crout decomposition ($u_{ii}=1$) otherwise.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#LU_Crout_decomposition
  For a matrix (where `M` is the shorter and `N` the longer side length) there will be
  - $M(M-1)N/2$ subtractions (`-`),
  - $M(M-1)N/2$ multiplications (`*`),
  - $M(M-1)/2$ divisions (`/`),
  so `M(M-1)N+M(M-1)/2` operations in total.
- `PLU(A)`: Return the PLU decomposition of `A`.
  Transformation happens in-place (`A` becomes `U`).
  For a MxN-matrix returns a MxM-, MxM- & MxN-matrix.
  Doolittle decomposition ($L_{ii}=1$).
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#LU_Crout_decomposition
  If `M>N` `LUQ` would be more efficient.
  There will be (`O=min(M-1, N)`)
  - $NO(2M-O-1)/2$ subtractions (`-`),
  - $NO(2M-O-1)/2$ multiplications (`*`),
  - $O(2M-O-1)/2$ divisions (`/`),
  so $NO(2M-O-1)+O(2M-O-1)/2$ operations in total.
- `LUQ(A)`: Return the LUQ decomposition of `A`.
  Transformation happens in-place (`A` becomes `L`).
  For a MxN-matrix returns a MxN-, NxN- & NxN-matrix.
  Crout decomposition ($U_{ii}=1$).
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#LU_Crout_decomposition
  If `M<N` `PLU` would be more memory efficient.
  For a MxN-matrix (`O=min(M, N-1)`) there will be
  - $MO(2N-O-1)/2$ subtractions (`-`),
  - $MO(2N-O-1)/2$ multiplications (`*`),
  - $O(2N-O-1)/2$ divisions (`/`),
  so $MO(2N-O-1)+O(2N-O-1)/2$ operations in total.
- `PLUQ(A)`: Return the PLUQ decomposition of `A`.
  Transformation happens in-place (`A` becomes `U` for Doolittle, `L` for Crout).
  For a MxN-matrix returns a MxM-, MxM-, MxN- & NxN-matrix for Doolittle or a MxM-, MxN-, NxN & NxN-matrix for Crout (automatically most memory efficient).
  Doolittle decomposition ($l_{ii}=1$) if `M<=N`, Crout decomposition ($u_{ii}=1$) otherwise.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#LU_Crout_decomposition
  For a matrix (where `M` is the shorter and `N` the longer side length) there will be
  - $M(M-1)N/2$ subtractions (`-`),
  - $M(M-1)N/2$ multiplications (`*`),
  - $M(M-1)/2$ divisions (`/`),
  so $M(M-1)N+M(M-1)/2$ operations in total.

### Random Creation

- `randint(low, high=None, size=None)`: Return a random `int` or an array of random `int`s.
  Like `numpy.random.randint` but with native `int`s.
- `randf(shape=None, precision=1000)`: Return a random `Fraction` or an array of random `Fraction`s.
  Their numerators `n` are `-precision <= n <= +precision` and their denominators `d` are `1 <= d <= +precision`.

### Utility

- `posneg(x, s)`: Return `+x` if `s==True` or `-x` if `s==False`.
  To use the unary operators `+` (`__pos__`) & `-` (`__neg__`) instead of multiplication with `+1` & `-1` (`__mul__`) as the univariate operators may be more optimised and multiplication with integers doesn't have to be implemented (might be the case for custom prototyped number types).
- `_sum(iterable)`: Like `sum` but without initial '+0'.
  For `float`s keep using `sum` for better precision.
  See [README.md#todo](README.md#Conventions) for justification.
- `_prod(iterable)`: Like `math.prod` but for non-numeric types.
  `math.prod` might reject non-numeric types: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.prod.
  For `float`s keep using `math.prod` for better precision.
  See [README.md#todo](README.md#Conventions) for justification.
- `assert_matrix(A)`: Assert matrix.
- `assert_sqmatrix(A)`: Assert square matrix.
- `swap_rows(A, i, j)`: Swap the `i`-th and `j`-th row of `A` in-place.
- `swap_columns(A, i, j)`: Swap the `i`-th and `j`-th column of `A` in-place.
- `swap_pivot(A, p, i, j)`: Swap the `p`-&`i`-th rows and `p`-&`j`-th columns of `A` in-place.
- `submatrix(A, i, j)`: Return a copy of `A` without the `i`-th row and `j`-th column.
- `_permutations(iterable, r=None)`: `itertools.permutation`, but yields `permutation, parity`.

### `Progress`

Progress handler for algorithms.
Use as context.
Total number of operations must be known beforehand.
Call `update(op, n=1)` to increment tracking.
- `__init__(totals, descprefix='')`: Create a new progress handler.
  `totals` should be a dictionary with the tracked operations as keys and the total number of operations as values.
- `__enter__()`
- `__exit__(type, value, traceback)`
- `update(op, n=1)`: Increment the operation `op` progress by `n`.
  If `op` is not tracked nothing happens.

## Conventions

- Elements obviously must support the required scalar operations. This includes operations with special integers: `+int(0)` & `*int(1)` should yield the same scalar, `*int(-1)` should yield the additional inverse. Exception: `posneg`, `_sum` & `_prod` used wherever possible for optimisation (some custom number types may be badly optimised/would need branching in arithmetic methods, e.g. [goessl/sqrtfractions](https://github.com/goessl/sqrtfractions)) and correct operation counting for complexity analysis.
- Matrices are represented as `numpy.ndarray`s.
- Elements are assumed to be exact. E.g. Gaussian elemination only stops if the pivot `A[i, i]` is `bool(A[i, i])==False`. Or doesn't reduce elements to the lower left of the pivot because they should already be eliminated to zero.
- Progress visualisation is done with the `progress=set()` argument. Specify which operations should be tracked (e.g. `{'+', '*'}`) and `tqdm` bars will visualise the progress.

## todo

- [x] `sum` & `prod` for non-numeric types (`math.prod` might reject non-numerics; both have `start` argument with unnecessary additional operation; but have better float precision -> automatic fallback?)
- [x] complexities
- [ ] progress visualisation with `tqdm`
- [ ] minimum dimensions (do functions work for 0x0-matrices?)
